                                            preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                            container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                            PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                            container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                            period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                            or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                        RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                        This overrides the pod-level restart policy. When this field is not specified,
                                        the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                        Additionally, setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will
                                        have the following effect:
                                        this init container will be continually restarted on
                                        exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                        containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                        will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                        is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                        container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                        for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                        container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                        init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                        completed.

                                    user-initiated activities such as debugging. Ephemeral containers have no resource or
                                    scheduling guarantees, and they will not be restarted when they exit or when a Pod is
                                    removed or restarted. The kubelet may evict a Pod if an ephemeral container causes the
                                    Pod to exceed its resource allocation.

                                    To add an ephemeral container, use the ephemeralcontainers subresource of an existing
                                    Pod. Ephemeral containers may not be removed or restarted.

                                            PreStop is called immediately before a container is terminated due to an
                                            API request or management event such as liveness/startup probe failure,
                                            preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                            container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                            PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                            container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                            period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                            or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                              If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                                              If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made

                                            container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                            PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                            container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                            period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                            or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                        RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                        This overrides the pod-level restart policy. When this field is not specified,
                                        the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                        Additionally, setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will
                                        have the following effect:
                                        this init container will be continually restarted on
                                        exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                        containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                        will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                        is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                        container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                        for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                        container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                        init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                        completed.

                                      seLinuxChangePolicy defines how the container's SELinux label is applied to all volumes used by the Pod.
                                      It has no effect on nodes that do not support SELinux or to volumes does not support SELinux.
                                      Valid values are "MountOption" and "Recursive".

                                      "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
                                      This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

                                      "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
                                      This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
                                      It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
                                      Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
                                      whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their
                                      CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.
                                      "MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled.

                                      If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption" is used.
                                      If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is disabled, "MountOption" is used for ReadWriteOncePod volumes
                                      and "Recursive" for all other volumes.

                                      This field affects only Pods that have SELinux label set, either in PodSecurityContext or in SecurityContext of all containers.

                                      All Pods that use the same volume should use the same seLinuxChangePolicy, otherwise some pods can get stuck in ContainerCreating state.

                                        MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select the pods over which
                                        spreading will be calculated. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                        incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are ANDed with labelSelector
                                        to select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculated
                                        for the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.
                                        MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.
                                        Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels will
                                        be ignored. A null or empty list means only match against labelSelector.

                                        MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                                        When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                                        between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                        The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                        or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                        labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                        In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                                        | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                        |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                                        - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                        scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                        violate MaxSkew(1).
                                        - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                        When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                                        to topologies that satisfy it.
                                        It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                                        MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                        When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                        Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                        And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                        this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                        As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                        scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                        If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                        Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                        When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                        labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                        | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                        |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                        The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                        In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                        because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                        it will violate MaxSkew.

                                        TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key
                                        and identical values are considered to be in the same topology.
                                        We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
                                        of pods into each bucket.
                                        We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.
                                        Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of
                                        nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.
                                        e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology.

                                        A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
                                        if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate

                                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same

                                        If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
                                        to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies

                                        ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                                        The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                        and deleted when the pod is removed.

                                        Use this if:
                                        a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                        b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                           tracking are needed,
                                        c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                        d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                           a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                           information on the connection between this volume type
                                           and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                                        Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                        APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                        of an individual pod.

                                        Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                        be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                        more information.

                                        A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                        persistent volumes at the same time.

                                            The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                            owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                            pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                            `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                            entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                            is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                                            An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                            will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                            volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                            the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                            meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                            owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                            this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                            manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                                    dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                                    volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                                    core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                                    When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of

                                                    provisioner.
                                                    This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                                    if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                                    compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                    both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                                    value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                                    When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                    dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                                    There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                                    * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                                      allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                                    * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                                      preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                                      specified.
                                                    * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                                      in any namespaces.
                                                    (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                                    (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                            Ex. "ext4", "xfs", "ntfs". The default filesystem depends on FlexVolume script.

                                        image represents an OCI object (a container image or artifact) pulled and mounted on the kubelet's host machine.
                                        The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

                                        - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                                        - Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                        - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

                                        The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
                                        A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
                                        The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
                                        The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
                                        The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
                                        Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath) before 1.33.
                                        The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

                                            Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                            IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.
                                            Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise.

                                                            If not specified, the volume defaultMode will be used.

                                                description: |-
                                                  Projects an auto-rotating credential bundle (private key and certificate
                                                  chain) that the pod can use either as a TLS client or server.

                                                  Kubelet generates a private key and uses it to send a
                                                  PodCertificateRequest to the named signer.  Once the signer approves the
                                                  request and issues a certificate chain, Kubelet writes the key and
                                                  certificate chain to the pod filesystem.  The pod does not start until
                                                  certificates have been issued for each podCertificate projected volume
                                                  source in its spec.

                                                  Kubelet will begin trying to rotate the certificate at the time indicated
                                                  by the signer using the PodCertificateRequest.Status.BeginRefreshAt
                                                  timestamp.

                                                  Kubelet can write a single file, indicated by the credentialBundlePath
                                                  field, or separate files, indicated by the keyPath and
                                                  certificateChainPath fields.

                                                  The credential bundle is a single file in PEM format.  The first PEM
                                                  entry is the private key (in PKCS#8 format), and the remaining PEM
                                                  entries are the certificate chain issued by the signer (typically,
                                                  signers will return their certificate chain in leaf-to-root order).

                                                  Prefer using the credential bundle format, since your application code
                                                  can read it atomically.  If you use keyPath and certificateChainPath,
                                                  your application must make two separate file reads. If these coincide
                                                  with a certificate rotation, it is possible that the private key and leaf
                                                  certificate you read may not correspond to each other.  Your application
                                                  will need to check for this condition, and re-read until they are
                                                  consistent.

                                                  The named signer controls chooses the format of the certificate it
                                                  issues; consult the signer implementation's documentation to learn how to
                                                  use the certificates it issues.
                                                properties:
                                                  certificateChainPath:
                                                    description: |-
                                                      Write the certificate chain at this path in the projected volume.

                                                      Most applications should use credentialBundlePath.  When using keyPath
                                                      and certificateChainPath, your application needs to check that the key
                                                      and leaf certificate are consistent, because it is possible to read the
                                                      files mid-rotation.
                                                    type: string
                                                  credentialBundlePath:
                                                    description: |-
                                                      Write the credential bundle at this path in the projected volume.

                                                      The credential bundle is a single file that contains multiple PEM blocks.
                                                      The first PEM block is a PRIVATE KEY block, containing a PKCS#8 private
                                                      key.

                                                      The remaining blocks are CERTIFICATE blocks, containing the issued
                                                      certificate chain from the signer (leaf and any intermediates).

                                                      Using credentialBundlePath lets your Pod's application code make a single
                                                      atomic read that retrieves a consistent key and certificate chain.  If you
                                                      project them to separate files, your application code will need to
                                                      additionally check that the leaf certificate was issued to the key.

                                                      will reject values shorter than 3600 (1 hour).  The maximum allowable
                                                      value is 7862400 (91 days).

                                                      The signer implementation is then free to issue a certificate with any
                                                      lifetime *shorter* than MaxExpirationSeconds, but no shorter than 3600
                                                      seconds (1 hour).  This constraint is enforced by kube-apiserver.
                                                      `kubernetes.io` signers will never issue certificates with a lifetime
                                                      longer than 24 hours.

                          Hostnames defines a set of hostnames that should match against the HTTP Host
                          header to select a HTTPRoute used to process the request. Implementations
                          MUST ignore any port value specified in the HTTP Host header while
                          performing a match and (absent of any applicable header modification
                          configuration) MUST forward this header unmodified to the backend.

                          Valid values for Hostnames are determined by RFC 1123 definition of a
                          hostname with 2 notable exceptions:

                          1. IPs are not allowed.
                          2. A hostname may be prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`). The wildcard
                             label must appear by itself as the first label.

                          If a hostname is specified by both the Listener and HTTPRoute, there
                          must be at least one intersecting hostname for the HTTPRoute to be
                          attached to the Listener. For example:

                          * A Listener with `test.example.com` as the hostname matches HTTPRoutes
                            that have either not specified any hostnames, or have specified at
                            least one of `test.example.com` or `*.example.com`.
                          * A Listener with `*.example.com` as the hostname matches HTTPRoutes
                            that have either not specified any hostnames or have specified at least
                            one hostname that matches the Listener hostname. For example,
                            `*.example.com`, `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com` would
                            all match. On the other hand, `example.com` and `test.example.net` would
                            not match.

                          Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`) are interpreted
                          as a suffix match. That means that a match for `*.example.com` would match
                          both `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`.

                          If both the Listener and HTTPRoute have specified hostnames, any
                          HTTPRoute hostnames that do not match the Listener hostname MUST be
                          ignored. For example, if a Listener specified `*.example.com`, and the
                          HTTPRoute specified `test.example.com` and `test.example.net`,
                          `test.example.net` must not be considered for a match.

                          If both the Listener and HTTPRoute have specified hostnames, and none
                          match with the criteria above, then the HTTPRoute is not accepted. The
                          implementation must raise an 'Accepted' Condition with a status of
                          `False` in the corresponding RouteParentStatus.

                          In the event that multiple HTTPRoutes specify intersecting hostnames (e.g.
                          overlapping wildcard matching and exact matching hostnames), precedence must
                          be given to rules from the HTTPRoute with the largest number of:

                          * Characters in a matching non-wildcard hostname.
                          * Characters in a matching hostname.

                          If ties exist across multiple Routes, the matching precedence rules for
                          HTTPRouteMatches takes over.

                            Hostname is the fully qualified domain name of a network host. This matches

                          ParentRefs references the resources (usually Gateways) that a Route wants
                          to be attached to. Note that the referenced parent resource needs to
                          allow this for the attachment to be complete. For Gateways, that means
                          the Gateway needs to allow attachment from Routes of this kind and
                          namespace. For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same
                          namespace for a "producer" route, or the mesh implementation must support
                          and allow "consumer" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is
                          not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to
                          create a "producer" route for a Service in a different namespace from the
                          Route.

                          There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:

                          * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
                          * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)

                          This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
                          resources.

                          ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:

                          * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef
                            entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the
                            multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must
                            be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
                          * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,
                            each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of
                            optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a
                            combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.

                          Some examples:

                          * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
                            same object must also set `sectionName`.
                          * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
                            object must also set `port`.
                          * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
                            referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.

                          It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
                          be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
                          choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the
                          case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be
                          merged.

                          Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific
                          rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                          allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example,
                          Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a

                          ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                          routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                          any namespace to the Service.

                          ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                          "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                          connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                          the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                          ParentRef of the Route.

                                Failure behavior here depends on how many BackendRefs are specified and
                                how many are invalid.

                                If *all* entries in BackendRefs are invalid, and there are also no filters
                                specified in this route rule, *all* traffic which matches this rule MUST
                                receive a 500 status code.

                                See the HTTPBackendRef definition for the rules about what makes a single
                                HTTPBackendRef invalid.

                                When a HTTPBackendRef is invalid, 500 status codes MUST be returned for
                                requests that would have otherwise been routed to an invalid backend. If
                                multiple backends are specified, and some are invalid, the proportion of
                                requests that would otherwise have been routed to an invalid backend
                                MUST receive a 500 status code.

                                For example, if two backends are specified with equal weights, and one is
                                invalid, 50 percent of traffic must receive a 500. Implementations may

                                When a HTTPBackendRef refers to a Service that has no ready endpoints,
                                implementations SHOULD return a 503 for requests to that backend instead.
                                If an implementation chooses to do this, all of the above rules for 500 responses
                                MUST also apply for responses that return a 503.

                                  When the BackendRef points to a Kubernetes Service, implementations SHOULD
                                  honor the appProtocol field if it is set for the target Service Port.

                                  Implementations supporting appProtocol SHOULD recognize the Kubernetes
                                  Standard Application Protocols defined in KEP-3726.

                                  If a Service appProtocol isn't specified, an implementation MAY infer the
                                  backend protocol through its own means. Implementations MAY infer the
                                  protocol from the Route type referring to the backend Service.

                                  If a Route is not able to send traffic to the backend using the specified
                                  protocol then the backend is considered invalid. Implementations MUST set the
                                  "ResolvedRefs" condition to "False" with the "UnsupportedProtocol" reason.

                                                Header names are not case sensitive.

                                                When the `AllowHeaders` field is configured with one or more headers, the

                                                If any header name in the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` response header

                                                A wildcard indicates that the requests with all HTTP headers are allowed.
                                                The `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` response header can only use `*`
                                                wildcard as value when the `AllowCredentials` field is false or omitted.

                                                Valid values are any method defined by RFC9110, along with the special
                                                value `*`, which represents all HTTP methods are allowed.

                                                Method names are case sensitive, so these values are also case-sensitive.
                                                (See https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2616#section-5.1.1)

                                                A CORS-safelisted method is a method that is `GET`, `HEAD`, or `POST`.
                                                (See https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#cors-safelisted-method) The

                                                are specified in the `AllowMethods` field.

                                                When the `AllowMethods` field is configured with one or more methods, the

                                                which value is present in the `AllowMethods` field.

                                                If the HTTP method of the `Access-Control-Request-Method` request header
                                                is not included in the list of methods specified by the response header
                                                `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, it will present an error on the client
                                                side.

                                                The `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` response header can only use `*`
                                                wildcard as value when the `AllowCredentials` field is false or omitted.

                                                When the `AllowCredentials` field is true and `AllowMethods` field
                                                specified with the `*` wildcard, the gateway must specify one HTTP method
                                                in the value of the Access-Control-Allow-Methods response header. The
                                                value of the header `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` is same as the
                                                `Access-Control-Request-Method` header provided by the client. If the
                                                header `Access-Control-Request-Method` is not included in the request,
                                                the gateway will omit the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` response header,

                                                choose to add implementation-specific default methods.

                                                AllowOrigins indicates whether the response can be shared with requested
                                                resource from the given `Origin`.

                                                The `Origin` consists of a scheme and a host, with an optional port, and
                                                takes the form `<scheme>://<host>(:<port>)`.

                                                Valid values for scheme are: `http` and `https`.

                                                Valid values for port are any integer between 1 and 65535 (the list of
                                                available TCP/UDP ports). Note that, if not included, port `80` is
                                                assumed for `http` scheme origins, and port `443` is assumed for `https`
                                                origins. This may affect origin matching.

                                                The host part of the origin may contain the wildcard character `*`. These
                                                wildcard characters behave as follows:

                                                * `*` is a greedy match to the _left_, including any number of
                                                  DNS labels to the left of its position. This also means that
                                                  `*` will include any number of period `.` characters to the
                                                  left of its position.
                                                * A wildcard by itself matches all hosts.

                                                An origin value that includes _only_ the `*` character indicates requests
                                                from all `Origin`s are allowed.

                                                When the `AllowOrigins` field is configured with multiple origins, it
                                                means the server supports clients from multiple origins. If the request
                                                `Origin` matches the configured allowed origins, the gateway must return
                                                the given `Origin` and sets value of the header
                                                `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` same as the `Origin` header provided by the
                                                client.

                                                The status code of a successful response to a "preflight" request is
                                                always an OK status (i.e., 204 or 200).

                                                If the request `Origin` does not match the configured allowed origins,
                                                the gateway returns 204/200 response but doesn't set the relevant
                                                cross-origin response headers. Alternatively, the gateway responds with
                                                403 status to the "preflight" request is denied, coupled with omitting
                                                the CORS headers. The cross-origin request fails on the client side.
                                                Therefore, the client doesn't attempt the actual cross-origin request.

                                                The `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header can only use `*`
                                                wildcard as value when the `AllowCredentials` field is false or omitted.

                                                When the `AllowCredentials` field is true and `AllowOrigins` field
                                                specified with the `*` wildcard, the gateway must return a single origin
                                                in the value of the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header,
                                                instead of specifying the `*` wildcard. The value of the header
                                                `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is same as the `Origin` header provided by
                                                the client.

                                                to client-side scripts in response to a cross-origin request.

                                                A CORS-safelisted response header is an HTTP header in a CORS response
                                                that it is considered safe to expose to the client scripts.
                                                The CORS-safelisted response headers include the following headers:
                                                `Cache-Control`
                                                `Content-Language`

                                                `Content-Type`
                                                `Expires`
                                                `Last-Modified`

                                                (See https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#cors-safelisted-response-header-name)
                                                The CORS-safelisted response headers are exposed to client by default.

                                                When an HTTP header name is specified using the `ExposeHeaders` field,
                                                this additional header will be exposed as part of the response to the
                                                client.

                                                Header names are not case sensitive.

                                                Multiple header names in the value of the `Access-Control-Expose-Headers`
                                                response header are separated by a comma (",").

                                                A wildcard indicates that the responses with all HTTP headers are exposed
                                                to clients. The `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` response header can only
                                                use `*` wildcard as value when the `AllowCredentials` field is false or omitted.

                                                    `maxSize`, then the body sent to the authorization server must be
                                                    truncated to `maxSize` bytes.

                                                    Experimental note: This behavior needs to be checked against
                                                    various dataplanes; it may need to be changed.

                                                    The following headers must always be sent to the authorization server,

                                                    Note that `Content-Length` has a special behavior, in that the length

                                                    server - that is, it must reflect the actual number of bytes sent in the
                                                    body of the request to the authorization server.

                                                    So if the `forwardBody` stanza is unset, or `forwardBody.maxSize` is set

                                                    to anything other than `0`, then the `Content-Length` of the authorization
                                                    request must be set to the actual number of bytes forwarded.

                                                    match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                                    to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch

                                                    Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                                    matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                                    in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                                    ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all

                                                  port associated with the redirect scheme. Specifically "http" to port 80
                                                  and "https" to port 443. If the redirect scheme does not have a

                                                * A Location header that will use HTTP (whether that is determined via
                                                  the Listener protocol or the Scheme field) _and_ use port 80.

                                            Type identifies the type of filter to apply. As with other API fields,
                                            types are classified into three conformance levels:

                                            - Core: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                              "Support: Core" in this package, e.g. "RequestHeaderModifier". All
                                              implementations must support core filters.

                                            - Extended: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                              "Support: Extended" in this package, e.g. "RequestMirror". Implementers
                                              are encouraged to support extended filters.

                                            - Implementation-specific: Filters that are defined and supported by
                                              specific vendors.
                                              In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior across multiple
                                              implementations will be considered for inclusion in extended or core
                                              conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters
                                              is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` should be set to
                                              "ExtensionRef" for custom filters.

                                            Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to
                                            extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.

                                            If a reference to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                                            MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have been processed by
                                            that filter MUST receive a HTTP error response.

                                            Note that values may be added to this enum, implementations
                                            must ensure that unknown values will not cause a crash.

                                            Unknown values here must result in the implementation setting the
                                            Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`, with a
                                            Reason of `UnsupportedValue`.

                                                    of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".

                                                    Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                                    matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                                    in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                                    ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                                    match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.

                                                    ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                                    Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                                    the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                                      Weight specifies the proportion of requests forwarded to the referenced
                                      backend. This is computed as weight/(sum of all weights in this
                                      BackendRefs list). For non-zero values, there may be some epsilon from

                                      implementation supports. Weight is not a percentage and the sum of
                                      weights does not need to equal 100.

                                      If only one backend is specified and it has a weight greater than 0, 100%
                                      of the traffic is forwarded to that backend. If weight is set to 0, no
                                      traffic should be forwarded for this entry. If unspecified, weight
                                      defaults to 1.

                                Filters define the filters that are applied to requests that match
                                this rule.

                                Wherever possible, implementations SHOULD implement filters in the order
                                they are specified.

                                Implementations MAY choose to implement this ordering strictly, rejecting
                                any combination or order of filters that cannot be supported. If implementations
                                choose a strict interpretation of filter ordering, they MUST clearly document
                                that behavior.

                                To reject an invalid combination or order of filters, implementations SHOULD
                                consider the Route Rules with this configuration invalid. If all Route Rules
                                in a Route are invalid, the entire Route would be considered invalid. If only
                                a portion of Route Rules are invalid, implementations MUST set the
                                "PartiallyInvalid" condition for the Route.

                                Conformance-levels at this level are defined based on the type of filter:

                                - ALL core filters MUST be supported by all implementations.
                                - Implementers are encouraged to support extended filters.
                                - Implementation-specific custom filters have no API guarantees across
                                  implementations.

                                Specifying the same filter multiple times is not supported unless explicitly
                                indicated in the filter.

                                All filters are expected to be compatible with each other except for the
                                URLRewrite and RequestRedirect filters, which may not be combined. If an
                                implementation cannot support other combinations of filters, they must clearly
                                document that limitation. In cases where incompatible or unsupported
                                filters are specified and cause the `Accepted` condition to be set to status
                                `False`, implementations may use the `IncompatibleFilters` reason to specify
                                this configuration error.

                                          accessing the requested resource.

                                          Header names are not case sensitive.

                                          Multiple header names in the value of the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`
                                          response header are separated by a comma (",").

                                          When the `AllowHeaders` field is configured with one or more headers, the
                                          gateway must return the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` response header
                                          which value is present in the `AllowHeaders` field.

                                          If any header name in the `Access-Control-Request-Headers` request header
                                          is not included in the list of header names specified by the response
                                          header `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`, it will present an error on the
                                          client side.

                                          If any header name in the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` response header
                                          does not recognize by the client, it will also occur an error on the
                                          client side.

                                          A wildcard indicates that the requests with all HTTP headers are allowed.
                                          The `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` response header can only use `*`
                                          wildcard as value when the `AllowCredentials` field is false or omitted.

                                          When the `AllowCredentials` field is true and `AllowHeaders` field
                                          specified with the `*` wildcard, the gateway must specify one or more
                                          HTTP headers in the value of the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` response
                                          header. The value of the header `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` is same as
                                          the `Access-Control-Request-Headers` header provided by the client. If
                                          the header `Access-Control-Request-Headers` is not included in the
                                          request, the gateway will omit the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`
                                          response header, instead of specifying the `*` wildcard. A Gateway
                                          implementation may choose to add implementation-specific default headers.

                                          value `*`, which represents all HTTP methods are allowed.

                                          Method names are case sensitive, so these values are also case-sensitive.
                                          (See https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2616#section-5.1.1)

                                          Multiple method names in the value of the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`
                                          response header are separated by a comma (",").

                                          A CORS-safelisted method is a method that is `GET`, `HEAD`, or `POST`.
                                          (See https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#cors-safelisted-method) The
                                          CORS-safelisted methods are always allowed, regardless of whether they
                                          are specified in the `AllowMethods` field.

                                          When the `AllowMethods` field is configured with one or more methods, the
                                          gateway must return the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` response header
                                          which value is present in the `AllowMethods` field.

                                          If the HTTP method of the `Access-Control-Request-Method` request header
                                          is not included in the list of methods specified by the response header
                                          `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, it will present an error on the client
                                          side.

                                          The `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` response header can only use `*`
                                          wildcard as value when the `AllowCredentials` field is false or omitted.

                                          When the `AllowCredentials` field is true and `AllowMethods` field
                                          specified with the `*` wildcard, the gateway must specify one HTTP method
                                          in the value of the Access-Control-Allow-Methods response header. The
                                          value of the header `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` is same as the
                                          `Access-Control-Request-Method` header provided by the client. If the
                                          header `Access-Control-Request-Method` is not included in the request,
                                          the gateway will omit the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` response header,
                                          instead of specifying the `*` wildcard. A Gateway implementation may
                                          choose to add implementation-specific default methods.

                                          AllowOrigins indicates whether the response can be shared with requested
                                          resource from the given `Origin`.

                                          The `Origin` consists of a scheme and a host, with an optional port, and
                                          takes the form `<scheme>://<host>(:<port>)`.

                                          Valid values for scheme are: `http` and `https`.

                                          Valid values for port are any integer between 1 and 65535 (the list of
                                          available TCP/UDP ports). Note that, if not included, port `80` is
                                          assumed for `http` scheme origins, and port `443` is assumed for `https`
                                          origins. This may affect origin matching.

                                          The host part of the origin may contain the wildcard character `*`. These
                                          wildcard characters behave as follows:

                                          * `*` is a greedy match to the _left_, including any number of
                                            DNS labels to the left of its position. This also means that
                                            `*` will include any number of period `.` characters to the
                                            left of its position.
                                          * A wildcard by itself matches all hosts.

                                          An origin value that includes _only_ the `*` character indicates requests
                                          from all `Origin`s are allowed.

                                          When the `AllowOrigins` field is configured with multiple origins, it
                                          means the server supports clients from multiple origins. If the request
                                          `Origin` matches the configured allowed origins, the gateway must return
                                          the given `Origin` and sets value of the header
                                          `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` same as the `Origin` header provided by the
                                          client.

                                          The status code of a successful response to a "preflight" request is
                                          always an OK status (i.e., 204 or 200).

                                          If the request `Origin` does not match the configured allowed origins,
                                          the gateway returns 204/200 response but doesn't set the relevant
                                          cross-origin response headers. Alternatively, the gateway responds with
                                          403 status to the "preflight" request is denied, coupled with omitting
                                          the CORS headers. The cross-origin request fails on the client side.
                                          Therefore, the client doesn't attempt the actual cross-origin request.

                                          The `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header can only use `*`
                                          wildcard as value when the `AllowCredentials` field is false or omitted.

                                          When the `AllowCredentials` field is true and `AllowOrigins` field
                                          specified with the `*` wildcard, the gateway must return a single origin
                                          in the value of the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header,
                                          instead of specifying the `*` wildcard. The value of the header
                                          `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is same as the `Origin` header provided by
                                          the client.

                                          to client-side scripts in response to a cross-origin request.

                                          A CORS-safelisted response header is an HTTP header in a CORS response
                                          that it is considered safe to expose to the client scripts.
                                          The CORS-safelisted response headers include the following headers:
                                          `Cache-Control`
                                          `Content-Language`
                                          `Content-Length`
                                          `Content-Type`
                                          `Expires`

                                          The CORS-safelisted response headers are exposed to client by default.

                                          When an HTTP header name is specified using the `ExposeHeaders` field,
                                          this additional header will be exposed as part of the response to the
                                          client.

                                          Header names are not case sensitive.

                                          Multiple header names in the value of the `Access-Control-Expose-Headers`
                                          response header are separated by a comma (",").

                                          A wildcard indicates that the responses with all HTTP headers are exposed
                                          to clients. The `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` response header can only
                                          use `*` wildcard as value when the `AllowCredentials` field is false or omitted.

                                              The following headers must always be sent to the authorization server,
                                              regardless of this setting:

                                              * `Host`
                                              * `Method`
                                              * `Path`

                                              * `Authorization`

                                              If this list is empty, then only those headers must be sent.

                                              Note that `Content-Length` has a special behavior, in that the length
                                              sent must be correct for the actual request to the external authorization
                                              server - that is, it must reflect the actual number of bytes sent in the
                                              body of the request to the authorization server.

                                              So if the `forwardBody` stanza is unset, or `forwardBody.maxSize` is set

                                              to anything other than `0`, then the `Content-Length` of the authorization
                                              request must be set to the actual number of bytes forwarded.

                                              match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                              to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                              of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".

                                              Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                              matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                              in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                              ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                              match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.

                                              ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                              Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in

                                            and "https" to port 443. If the redirect scheme does not have a
                                            well-known port, the listener port of the Gateway SHOULD be used.

                                            Listener port.

                                          Implementations SHOULD NOT add the port number in the 'Location'
                                          header in the following cases:

                                          * A Location header that will use HTTP (whether that is determined via
                                            the Listener protocol or the Scheme field) _and_ use port 80.

                                      types are classified into three conformance levels:

                                      - Core: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                        "Support: Core" in this package, e.g. "RequestHeaderModifier". All
                                        implementations must support core filters.

                                      - Extended: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                        "Support: Extended" in this package, e.g. "RequestMirror". Implementers
                                        are encouraged to support extended filters.

                                      - Implementation-specific: Filters that are defined and supported by
                                        specific vendors.
                                        In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior across multiple
                                        implementations will be considered for inclusion in extended or core
                                        conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters
                                        is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` should be set to
                                        "ExtensionRef" for custom filters.

                                      Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to
                                      extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.

                                      If a reference to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                                      MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have been processed by
                                      that filter MUST receive a HTTP error response.

                                      Note that values may be added to this enum, implementations
                                      must ensure that unknown values will not cause a crash.

                                      Unknown values here must result in the implementation setting the
                                      Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`, with a
                                      Reason of `UnsupportedValue`.

                                              ReplaceFullPath specifies the value with which to replace the full path
                                              of a request during a rewrite or redirect.

                                          replacePrefixMatch:
                                            description: |-
                                              ReplacePrefixMatch specifies the value with which to replace the prefix
                                              match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                              to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                              of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".

                                              Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                              matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                              in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                              ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                              match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.

                                              ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                              Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                              the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                                HTTP requests. Each match is independent, i.e. this rule will be matched
                                if **any** one of the matches is satisfied.

                                For example, take the following matches configuration:

                                ```
                                matches:
                                - path:
                                    value: "/foo"
                                  headers:
                                  - name: "version"
                                    value: "v2"
                                - path:
                                    value: "/v2/foo"
                                ```

                                For a request to match against this rule, a request must satisfy
                                EITHER of the two conditions:

                                - path prefixed with `/foo` AND contains the header `version: v2`
                                - path prefix of `/v2/foo`

                                See the documentation for HTTPRouteMatch on how to specify multiple
                                match conditions that should be ANDed together.

                                If no matches are specified, the default is a prefix
                                path match on "/", which has the effect of matching every
                                HTTP request.

                                Proxy or Load Balancer routing configuration generated from HTTPRoutes
                                MUST prioritize matches based on the following criteria, continuing on
                                ties. Across all rules specified on applicable Routes, precedence must be
                                given to the match having:

                                * "Exact" path match.
                                * "Prefix" path match with largest number of characters.
                                * Method match.
                                * Largest number of header matches.
                                * Largest number of query param matches.

                                Note: The precedence of RegularExpression path matches are implementation-specific.

                                If ties still exist across multiple Routes, matching precedence MUST be
                                determined in order of the following criteria, continuing on ties:

                                * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp.
                                * The Route appearing first in alphabetical order by
                                  "{namespace}/{name}".

                                If ties still exist within an HTTPRoute, matching precedence MUST be granted
                                to the FIRST matching rule (in list order) with a match meeting the above
                                criteria.

                                When no rules matching a request have been successfully attached to the
                                parent a request is coming from, a HTTP 404 status code MUST be returned.

                                            Name is the name of the HTTP Header to be matched. Name matching MUST be
                                            case-insensitive. (See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2).

                                            If multiple entries specify equivalent header names, only the first
                                            entry with an equivalent name MUST be considered for a match. Subsequent
                                            entries with an equivalent header name MUST be ignored. Due to the
                                            case-insensitivity of header names, "foo" and "Foo" are considered

                                            Name is the name of the HTTP query param to be matched. This must be an
                                            exact string match. (See
                                            https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-2.7.3).

                                            If multiple entries specify equivalent query param names, only the first
                                            entry with an equivalent name MUST be considered for a match. Subsequent
                                            entries with an equivalent query param name MUST be ignored.

                                            If a query param is repeated in an HTTP request, the behavior is
                                            purposely left undefined, since different data planes have different
                                            capabilities. However, it is *recommended* that implementations should
                                            match against the first value of the param if the data plane supports it,
                                            as this behavior is expected in other load balancing contexts outside of
                                            the Gateway API.

                                            Users SHOULD NOT route traffic based on repeated query params to guard
                                            themselves against potential differences in the implementations.

                                    retry attempts and is represented in Gateway API Duration formatting.

                                    For example, setting the `rules[].retry.backoff` field to the value
                                    `100ms` will cause a backend request to first be retried approximately
                                    100 milliseconds after timing out or receiving a response code configured
                                    to be retryable.

                                    An implementation MAY use an exponential or alternative backoff strategy
                                    for subsequent retry attempts, MAY cap the maximum backoff duration to
                                    some amount greater than the specified minimum, and MAY add arbitrary
                                    jitter to stagger requests, as long as unsuccessful backend requests are
                                    not retried before the configured minimum duration.

                                    If a Request timeout (`rules[].timeouts.request`) is configured on the
                                    route, the entire duration of the initial request and any retry attempts
                                    MUST not exceed the Request timeout duration. If any retry attempts are
                                    still in progress when the Request timeout duration has been reached,
                                    these SHOULD be canceled if possible and the Gateway MUST immediately
                                    return a timeout error.

                                    If a BackendRequest timeout (`rules[].timeouts.backendRequest`) is
                                    configured on the route, any retry attempts which reach the configured
                                    BackendRequest timeout duration without a response SHOULD be canceled if
                                    possible and the Gateway should wait for at least the specified backoff
                                    duration before attempting to retry the backend request again.

                                    If a BackendRequest timeout is _not_ configured on the route, retry
                                    attempts MAY time out after an implementation default duration, or MAY
                                    remain pending until a configured Request timeout or implementation
                                    default duration for total request time is reached.

                                    When this field is unspecified, the time to wait between retry attempts
                                    is implementation-specific.

                                    BackendRequest specifies a timeout for an individual request from the gateway
                                    to a backend. This covers the time from when the request first starts being
                                    sent from the gateway to when the full response has been received from the backend.

                                    Setting a timeout to the zero duration (e.g. "0s") SHOULD disable the timeout
                                    completely. Implementations that cannot completely disable the timeout MUST
                                    instead interpret the zero duration as the longest possible value to which
                                    the timeout can be set.

                                    An entire client HTTP transaction with a gateway, covered by the Request timeout,
                                    may result in more than one call from the gateway to the destination backend,
                                    for example, if automatic retries are supported.

                                    The value of BackendRequest must be a Gateway API Duration string as defined by
                                    GEP-2257.  When this field is unspecified, its behavior is implementation-specific;
                                    when specified, the value of BackendRequest must be no more than the value of the
                                    Request timeout (since the Request timeout encompasses the BackendRequest timeout).

                                    Request specifies the maximum duration for a gateway to respond to an HTTP request.
                                    If the gateway has not been able to respond before this deadline is met, the gateway
                                    MUST return a timeout error.

                                    For example, setting the `rules.timeouts.request` field to the value `10s` in an
                                    `HTTPRoute` will cause a timeout if a client request is taking longer than 10 seconds
                                    to complete.

                                    Setting a timeout to the zero duration (e.g. "0s") SHOULD disable the timeout
                                    completely. Implementations that cannot completely disable the timeout MUST
                                    instead interpret the zero duration as the longest possible value to which
                                    the timeout can be set.

                                    This timeout is intended to cover as close to the whole request-response transaction
                                    as possible although an implementation MAY choose to start the timeout after the entire
                                    request stream has been received instead of immediately after the transaction is
                                    initiated by the client.

                                    The value of Request is a Gateway API Duration string as defined by GEP-2257. When this
                                    field is unspecified, request timeout behavior is implementation-specific.

                                          pathType determines the interpretation of the path matching. PathType can
                                          be one of the following values:
                                          * Exact: Matches the URL path exactly.
                                          * Prefix: Matches based on a URL path prefix split by '/'. Matching is
                                            done on a path element by element basis. A path element refers is the
                                            list of labels in the path split by the '/' separator. A request is a
                                            match for path p if every p is an element-wise prefix of p of the
                                            request path. Note that if the last element of the path is a substring
                                            of the last element in request path, it is not a match (e.g. /foo/bar
                                            matches /foo/bar/baz, but does not match /foo/barbaz).
                                          * ImplementationSpecific: Interpretation of the Path matching is up to
                                            the IngressClass. Implementations can treat this as a separate PathType
                                            or treat it identically to Prefix or Exact path types.
                                          Implementations are required to support all path types.

                          receive on one of the Service's "externally-facing" addresses (NodePorts,

                          the service in a way that assumes that external load balancers will take care
                          of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will deliver
                          traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading
                          the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will
                          be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of
                          routing to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and other
                          features). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP from
                          within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to
                          a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account
                          when picking a node.

                          through the Endpoints or EndpointSlice resources can safely assume this behavior.

                          type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to ClusterIP. Valid
                          options are ExternalName, ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer.
                          "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                          to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not
                          specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or
                          EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is
                          allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
                          than a virtual IP.
                          "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                          routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                          "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                          (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                          as the clusterIP.
                          "ExternalName" aliases this service to the specified externalName.
                          Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName services.
